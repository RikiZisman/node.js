# Article number 2: Features Workflow of a Branch

## Forking Workflow Analysis

### Use Cases

**Open Source Projects**

Forking workflow is mainly used in public open source projects. This workflow allows developers to contribute to the project without needing direct write access to the main repository. Each developer works on their own copy of the fork and submits changes through pull requests.

**Advanced Uses**

- **Untrusted Third-Party Collaboration**: As each contributor works on their own fork, the master project maintains security and integrity by not granting write access to all developers.
- **Large, Organic Teams**: The workflow supports large teams where developers can work independently and integrate their changes through the manager.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**

- **Security**: Maintaining the integrity of the master repository by restricting direct write access.
- **Flexibility**: Each developer has their own repository, which allows independent work and experiments.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large teams and open source projects involving many contributors.
- **Controlled Integration**: Administrators have full control over what is merged into the main repository.

**Disadvantages**

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple forks and pull requests can be complex.
- **Synchronization**: Keeping forks updated with the main repository can require extra effort.
- **Learning Curve**: New contributors may find the workflow challenging to understand at first.
